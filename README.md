# DSaPP Research Assistant and Volunteer Projects

At any given time, teachers of K12 schools across the US post projects of their students and donors can donate to them through DonorsChoose.org, a Charity organization that helps students in need of funding for projects. They help students with project resources once a project reaches its funding goal (fully_funded). This project is about helping DonorsChoose to find projects that are especially exciting at the time they get posted, for donors to make donations.
